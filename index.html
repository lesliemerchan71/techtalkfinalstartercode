            <P id = "me" >Something that not a lot of people know about me is that I was actually born in Ecuador, not in the United States. I came here at the age of one and I grew up in brooklyn ever since. At the moment I am 16 years old and will be turning 17 on October 1st. This upcoming Fall I will be a senior in high school which is nerve wrecking. I am already feeling stressed and it's summer. I should be relaxing and having fun, but I'd rather keep myself busy in programs and activities. I practice MUay Thai which is a form of kickboxing and I love it. I also hang out with my dog and my boyfriend. They're both a lot of fun. I also enjoy spending time with my dad. My mom passed away a few years ago and I know she's in a safe place. It was extremely tough for me and my dad and it still is, but we're getting thrpugh it together. Well that is just a little taste of my life and what I do. Thanks for listening, I know this was long.</P>
        <h3 id = "thirdHeading" >Here are a couple of pictures that are a part of me. You can check them out if you'd like.</h3>
